## Purpose
This is a simple web application built using create-react-app which pulls weather data from the dark sky api based on user submitted location, then matches the current weather/mood in that area to songs from Carly Rae Jepsen using Spotify API and setting backgrounds to random images related to the local weather from the Unsplash API.
